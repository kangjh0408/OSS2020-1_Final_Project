This is a README.md file for 2020-1 OSS Final Project
==============
My name is Jiho Kang, 21500014.  
'OSS_2020-1_Final_Projcet.py' was written by *Jiho Kang*.<br/>
The function of the sensor operation is used through an open source library.

What does this project do?
-
The subject of the project is the Real-Time Intruder Alert System.<br/>
 
Function
* Detect Intruder by using **Ultrasonic sensor**. 
* Mark the distance measured by ultrasonic sensors on **OLED**. 
* **Buzzer** makes warning sound when within a certain distance range. 
* The measured distance is transferred to the server using **Wi-Fi**. 

Why is this project useful?
- 
Cadillac(Car Manfacturing Co.) adopted a ultrasonic sensor that prevents intrusions by detecting internal movements after the door is locked. This example shows the efficiency of ultrasonic sensors. It is expected that damage caused by intruders will be greatly reduced by using ultrasonic sensors and by immediately sending warning messages to users using Wi-Fi communication.

How do I get started?

Python Module Install<br/>
1. Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04), Piezo Buzzer (SZH-SDBJ-007 ,Low+Passive) 
	* sudo pip install RPi.GPIO  
1. OLED (Monochrome 0.96 128x64 OLED graphic display ada-326) 
	* git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_SSD1306.git
1. Socket 
	* sudo pip install socket.py
